# COVID19 lung X-ray image classification: a comparison between fully connected vs CNN networks
- preprocessing and data exploration
- parameter search
- pipelining
- **models used**: fully connected neural net VS CNN
- **dataset**: COVID-19 X-ray image classification dataset available on Kaggle 
- **goal**: The problem involves prediction the presence of absence of COVID-19 using varying X-ray images. The input of this problem is a series of X-ray images of the chest, which goes into a prediction model and the model predicts based on the images if a person has COVID-19 or not. This is an image classification problem which is well suited for the implementation of neural networks.
