# X-ray image classificationL: a comparison between fully connected vs CNN networks

The problem involves prediction the presence of absence of COVID-19 using varying X-ray images. The input of this problem is a series of X-ray images of the chest, which goes into a prediction model and the model predicts based on the images if a person has COVID-19 or not. This is an image classification problem which is well suited for the implementation of neural networks.
